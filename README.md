When the user's browser is running ¬ªdark mode¬´, the dark color scheme will be used automatically. The default is the light/white color scheme. Check out the [`style.html`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/layouts/partials/style.html)-file for the implementation.

## Installation

If you already have a Hugo site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```
git submodule add https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog.git themes/hugo-bearblog
```

Then, adjust the `hugo.toml` as detailed below.

For more information, read the official [setup guide][hugo-setup-guide] of Hugo.

## Adjust configuration / hugo.toml

Please check out the [hugo.toml](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/exampleSite/hugo.toml) included in the [exampleSite](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/tree/master/exampleSite) of this theme.

## Content & structure

### Starting fresh

If you are starting fresh, simply copy over the contents of the `exampleSite`-directory included in this theme to your source directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

### Adding / editing content

#### Index-Page

The contents of the `index`-page may be changed by editing your `content/_index.md`-file.

#### Page

You can add **a new page** via running

```
hugo new my-new-page.md
```

#### Blog-Post

You can add **a new blog-post** via running

```
hugo new blog/my-new-post.md
```

### Adding your branding / colors / css

Add a `custom_head.html`-file to your `layouts/partials`-directory. In there you may add a `<style>`-tag, *or* you may add a `<link>`-tag referencing your own `custom.css` (in case you prefer to have a separate `.css`-file). Check out the [`style.html`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/layouts/partials/style.html)-file to find out which CSS-styles are applied by default.
