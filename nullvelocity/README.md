![tina-cloud-starter-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103008/130587027-995ccc45-a852-4f90-b658-13e8e0517339.gif)

This Next.js starter is powered by [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io) for you and your team to visually live edit the structured content of your website. âœ¨

The content is managed through Markdown and JSON files stored in your GitHub repository, and queried through Tina GraphQL API.

### Features

- [Tina Headless CMS](https://app.tina.io) for authentication, content modeling, visual editing and team management.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) deployment to visually edit your site from the `/admin` route.
- Local development workflow from the filesystem with a local GraqhQL server.

## Requirements

- Git, [Node.js Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), pnpm installed for local development.
- A [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io) account for live editing.

## Local Development

Install the project's dependencies:

> [!NOTE]  
> [Do you know the best package manager for Node.js?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/best-package-manager-for-node/) Using the right package manager can greatly enhance your development workflow. We recommend using pnpm for its speed and efficient handling of dependencies. Learn more about why pnpm might be the best choice for your projects by checking out this rule from SSW.


```
pnpm install
```

Run the project locally:

```
pnpm dev
```

### Local URLs

- http://localhost:3000 : browse the website
- http://localhost:3000/admin : connect to Tina Cloud and go in edit mode
- http://localhost:3000/exit-admin : log out of Tina Cloud

## Development tips

### Visual Studio Code GraphQL extension

[Install the GraphQL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) to benefit from type auto-completion.

### Typescript

A good way to ensure your components match the shape of your data is to leverage the auto-generated TypeScript types.
These are rebuilt when your `tina` config changes.
